Technically Interesting: The usage of physics sprites in conjunction with particles,
animation, and randomized spawning in classes and getting to know all the systems that 
Phaser offers and adding that together was an interesting challenge. 

Visual Style: The font is handmade and implemented by Margarita. The visual style is
cohesive and the sounds are very fitting. The achievement looks really good.
